      <h2>Grand Forks, North Dakota</h2>

      <p><div id="testP">3/10 This city has been named as the worst city to live in North Dakota! I was born here during the Great Flood and big snowstorm. Although it may have benefit with low prices, it has nothing to offer and a big disappointment. </div></p>

      <p>9/10 I lived here for 9 years and really enjoyed it. The  city had lots to offer and had big events like Bloomsday. Milk also came in a bag at school, and it tasted a lot better than milk in a carton. Humidity wasn't a problem so the summer was a lot more pleasurable.</p>

      <h2>Key West, Florida</h2>

      <p>7/10 This place had beautiful sunsets and a great community that supported each other. A lot of the buildings were run down and had cockroaches. Although the place had a lot of great activities to do, it is always super expensive and/or not child friendly. Summer is unbearable, but winter were always so nice.</p>

      <h2>Fairview Heights, Illinois</h2>

      <p>5/10 Things are a little bit more afforable here but the taxes are ridiculous. It's nice being near St. Louis and not to far from Chicago when it comes to concerts or big events. Southern Illinois is too humid for being surrounded by field of corn and not beaches summer are not really not that much fun here and neither are winters.</p>
